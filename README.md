## Description

This application, with the main user being a manager, generates a webpage that displays their team's basic information. The command-line application accepts user input and formats that input into a high-quality HTML file. It’s generated with the name of the employee, their position, email, employee ID, and depending on what position they have their office number, github username, or current university. This information (with links to email and github profile) will allow the manager quick access to their employee's information

## Installation

## Usage
